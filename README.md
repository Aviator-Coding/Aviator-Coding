### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a curious developer trying to bridge the OT/IT world. I love plc programming, robots, vision sensors, and dotnet.

I am currently extending my skills around OPC/UA and dotnet. 
I have a few projects I am working on. One is to collect images from various vision systems and store them in a central system. 

See Ya
